<h2>How It's Made:</h2>



<p>Tech used: HTML5, CSS3, & Javascript</p>

<p>I created the Lunchbox Foodtruck site to hone my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was still learning JavaScript at the time, so I only used a small bit of it in the website. It was one of my earliest forays into the language.  </p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>In the process of creating this website, I learned a great deal. I learned how to better structure an HTML page, how to use media queries, and how to use JavaScript to add interactivity. It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and I learned a lot in the process. </p>
